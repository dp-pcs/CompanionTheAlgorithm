# Mobile Feed Implementation - Matching Web Experience

## Overview

The iOS mobile app now replicates the core feed functionality from `thealgorithm.live`, allowing users to select multiple posts and perform bulk actions like generating replies and liking tweets.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Post Selection with Checkboxes** ✅
- Each post in the feed now has a checkbox for selection
- Selected posts are highlighted with a blue background tint
- Visual feedback matches the web interface

### 2. **Select All / Deselect All** ✅
- Added a toggle button at the top of the feed
- Shows total post count
- Allows quick selection/deselection of all posts

### 3. **Bulk Actions Bar** ✅
- Appears at the bottom of the screen when posts are selected
- Shows count of selected posts
- Contains two action buttons:
  - **Generate Replies** (Green button with sparkles icon)
  - **Like Selected** (Pink button with heart icon)
- Auto-dismisses after action completes

### 4. **API Integration** ✅

#### Bulk Generate Replies
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/replies/bulk-generate-and-queue`
- **Request**: `post_ids` as comma-separated string
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "total": 16,
    "successful": 15,
    "failed": 1,
    "results": [
      {"post_id": "...", "success": true, "message": "..."}
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Bulk Like Tweets
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/replies/twikit/like-tweets-bulk`
- **Request**: `tweet_ids` as comma-separated string
- **Response**: Same structure as bulk generate

### 5. **User Feedback** ✅
- Success alerts show results (e.g., "✓ Generated 15 of 16 replies!")
- Error alerts display meaningful error messages
- Loading indicators during bulk operations
- Post status updates in real-time

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

1. **`FeedView.swift`**
   - Added `BulkActionsBar` component
   - Added checkbox to each `FeedPostCell`
   - Added Select All/Deselect All button
   - Added success/error alerts

2. **`FeedViewModel.swift`**
   - Added `selectedPostIds` Set for tracking selection
   - Added `isBulkGenerating` and `isBulkLiking` flags
   - Added `toggleSelection()` and `toggleSelectAll()` methods
   - Added `bulkGenerateReplies()` method
   - Added `bulkLikePosts()` method

3. **`APIClient.swift`**
   - Added `BulkOperationResponse` and `BulkOperationResult` structs
   - Added `bulkGenerateReplies()` method
   - Added `bulkLikeTweets()` method
   - Added `performFormRequest()` helper for multipart form data

## Web vs Mobile Comparison

| Feature | Web (thealgorithm.live) | iOS Mobile App |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| Post Selection | ✅ Checkbox on each post | ✅ Checkbox on each post |
| Select All | ✅ Top of list | ✅ Top of list |
| Bulk Generate | ✅ Green button | ✅ Green button |
| Bulk Like | ✅ Pink button | ✅ Pink button |
| Loading States | ✅ Multi-step loader | ✅ Progress indicator |
| Success Messages | ✅ Toast notifications | ✅ Native alerts |
| Status Updates | ✅ Real-time | ✅ Real-time |

## How to Use

1. **Open Feed Tab**
   - Navigate to the Feed tab in the app
   - Posts will load automatically

2. **Select Posts**
   - Tap checkboxes on posts you want to act on
   - Or tap "Select All" to select all visible posts

3. **Perform Bulk Actions**
   - When posts are selected, the Bulk Actions Bar appears at the bottom
   - Tap **"Generate Replies"** to create AI replies for all selected posts
   - Tap **"Like"** to like all selected tweets on X.com

4. **Review Results**
   - Success message shows how many operations succeeded
   - Failed operations are reported with details
   - Post statuses update automatically

## Technical Notes

### Form Data Encoding
The bulk API endpoints expect multipart form data, so the app now includes a `performFormRequest()` helper that:
- Builds proper multipart boundaries
- Encodes form fields correctly
- Includes OAuth Bearer token in Authorization header

### State Management
- Selection state is managed in `FeedViewModel`
- UI automatically updates when selection changes
- Loading states prevent duplicate requests
- Alerts are dismissed after completion

### Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed
- HTTP error responses are parsed
- Decoding failures show debug info in logs

## Next Steps

**Recommended Enhancements:**
1. Add loading animation similar to web's multi-step loader
2. Add filter options (All / Unreplied / Replied)
3. Add Focus Mode for focused users
4. Add swipe gestures for quick actions
5. Add post preview before bulk generate

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Select individual posts
- [x] Select all posts
- [x] Deselect all posts
- [x] Generate replies for multiple posts
- [x] Like multiple posts
- [x] Verify success messages
- [x] Verify error handling
- [x] Check post status updates
- [x] Verify API calls match web format

## Backend Compatibility

The mobile app uses the **exact same API endpoints** as the web version:
- Same request format (multipart form data)
- Same response format (JSON with results array)
- Same authentication (OAuth Bearer token)
- Same error handling

This ensures 100% compatibility and consistent behavior between web and mobile.
